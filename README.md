# Data Structures and Algoriths Progress

This repo tracks my personal journey solving problems on LeetCode — one challenge at a time.
I’m using this space to grow my skills in data structures, algorithms, and clean coding.



💡 Why I’m Doing This

I’m not just solving problems for streaks or badges — I’m training my brain to think like an engineer.
Every problem helps me:

Break big challenges into smaller steps

Write code that’s simple and efficient

Spot common patterns in complex problems

Build confidence for technical interviews



🧩 What’s Inside

Arrays & Strings

Linked Lists

Trees 

Recursion & Backtracking

Dynamic Programming

Sorting & Searching

All solutions are written in Python, with clean logic and comments that explain how I approached the problem.



🚀 My Goals

Strengthen my DSA foundations for FAANG-level interviews

Learn to communicate my thought process clearly — because interviews aren’t just about code

Use these patterns as a foundation for AI/ML problem-solving later on


🌱 What I’ve Learned So Far

You don’t need to be perfect — consistency matters more.

Sometimes the “hard” problems just need the right perspective.

The best feeling is when a problem that used to confuse you suddenly makes sense.



✨ Final Thought

“Every problem you solve makes you a little more unstoppable.”
